{"query": "Document: There is indeed a transform called discrete Laplace transform and it is of course closely related to the $\\mathcal{Z}$-transform. The (unilateral) discrete Laplace transform of a sequence $f_n$ is defined by (cf. link)\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_T\\{f_n\\}=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}f_ne^{-snT}$$\n\nwith some $T&gt;0$.

{"query": "Document: So this thread is dedicated to posting of poor critiques of Marxian economics. First is diamonds in the desert. So it starts off with a man, a man of means, but not unlimited means, stranded in the desert. He is dehydrated and close to death. At this point another man comes along with apparently only carrying two items with him, and looking to make a deal. He sees the dehydrated man has a sack of diamonds all of good quality. Being a good capitalist he wants to make a deal; \"All your diamonds and you can have the water\". The dehydrated man gives him all he has for water. This example is one libertarian/liberal/capitalist apologists will use to prove value is subjective. How could it not? When you are dehydrated isn't water more valuable than a sack of diamonds? Such a great and simple thought experiment to show how Marx was wrong and capitalism is the best system ever. Well there are problems with this example:\n\n1. The first problem is probably the least obvious: Value isn't determined by extreme cases, value is an aggregate. One instance of a high price doesn't mean water is worth more than diamonds. \n\n2. In the aggregate trade is a zero sum gain. Rarely does one trade items of greatly mismatched value, especially with a currency as a medium of exchange. Pointing to a case of someone getting ripped off doesn't change this.\n\n3. It changes value into only the result of exchange without any context. Is it possible that diamonds literally litter the ground? That any person can just pick one up and trade it for anything? And is water a rare resource? If this is the cause then it is a fine example of LTV. One can't assume that this abstraction is like the real world in all cases except where it comes to the exchange itself. \n\n\nAnyone else have examples of poor liberal/libertarian/capitalist thought experiments that they believe disproves Marxian economics?
